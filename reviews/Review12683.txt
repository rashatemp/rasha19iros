Comments to the author
======================

This paper proposed a criterion for unlabeled image
selection based on gradients. The experimental results show
the effectiveness of this idea. Generally, this paper is
well written and easy to understand. However, the
contribution is kind of limited. 

In section iii-b the author mentioned “Pseudo ground truth
is generated for all unlabeled images by assigning pixels
to the selected clusters, and the loss is computed with
respect to it.”  Does the Pseudo ground truth is provided
by human labors? How does the clusters are selected?

To calculate the norm of gradients, only one epoch is run
for each image. However, the gradient is affected by from
where it starts. If it is in the saddle point area, it
could be small. The author should justify the reason of
using a single epoch.

The proportion for training-validation-testing is weird,
why not 6-2-2?

In fig.1, doe the refinement only happens to the decoder or
the entire network?

Does this idea work for other popular dataset like VOC and
COCO? It could be more persuasive if comparison with state
of art can be provided.
